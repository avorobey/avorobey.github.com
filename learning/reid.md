1.1. In $$Z$$, consider $$(5) \cup (6)$$. Any ideal that includes both $$5$$ and $$6$$ must
include $$1$$, so it's all of $$Z$$.

1.2. In $$Z$$, let $$I,J = (3) = 3Z$$. Then $$IJ$$ is $$(9)$$, but $$I \cap J$$ is $$(3)$$. More generally,
in $$Z$$ let $$I = (a), J = (b)$$, then if $$a,b$$ are not co-prime, $$IJ != I\cap J$$.
