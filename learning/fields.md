Introduction to the course

This course deals with the relationships between the arithmetic properties of fields
and the group-theoretic properties of their Galois groups. Given a field $$K$$, we can look
at the Galois group of some extension, $$Gal(N/K)$$, or even the absolute Galois group (to
be defined later) $$G(K)$$. What can be said about the connections between them?

A trivial example. $$Gal(K)==1$$ means there are no symmetries of roots of irreducible polynomials
$$\iff$$ $$K$$ is separably closed, meaning $$K$$ has no nontrivial separable extensions.

(Note: this isn't the same thing as $$K$$ being algebraically closed. An example to illustrate this:
$$F_p(t) \to F_p^{sep}(t) \to \tilde{F}_p$$.
