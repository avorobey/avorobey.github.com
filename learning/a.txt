The trouble is, I don't know anyone named Leonard Mirtle. There must be something wrong with me. I hope
I'll know what it is soon. I hope I can fix it.

This sci-fi convention is much larger than I thought it could be. It's completely taken over the schoolyard of a local high school,
with dozens of tents on the ground selling merchandise to a small army of fans. Books and comics and figurines and posters and
jewelry and plastic swords and capes and. I move along, I weave between groups of fans, I barely give it all a glance. I'd like
to stop and browse for a while and go home empty-handed, probably. But I need to get to the lecture halls, fast. The event's
about to begin.

As I enter the small auditorium, I see the room is almost full, and down below on the stage the panelists are just taking their seats.
